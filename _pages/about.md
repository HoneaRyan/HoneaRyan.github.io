Hey! Welcome to Honea.info. I'm Ryan Honea, a Master's student at Austin Peay State Univeristy. I'm pursuing a degree in Predictive Analytics with aspirations for a Ph.D. in some variation of Operations Research and Statistics. I enjoy developing various software applications in my freetime and tinkering with new projects. My current projects in the works are:

* Research in Education regarding the First-Year Experience (Manuscript in Progress)
* Research in Queuing Theory and Stochastic Processes (Abstract hopefully coming soon!)
* Machine Learning Library in Python (for personal and learning use)

Feel free to check out my [Blog Posts](http://honea.info/year-archive/) if you are interested in any thoughts that might be on my mind regarding various open or closed problems that I feel like working on. As I move into my second semester of graduate school, I hope to become much more active in posting here.
