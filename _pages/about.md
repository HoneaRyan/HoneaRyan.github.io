Hey! Welcome to Honea.info. My name is Ryan Honea, and I am currently working as Project Management Analyst at FedEx. This includes everything from making simple bar charts to building complex models to understand and parse through years of complex shipping data. Alongside my work inside FedEx, I am actively working on several projects:

* Research in Education regarding the First-Year Experience (Manuscript Complete, Editing in Progress)
* Research in modified Random-Walks and Stochastic Processes (check out the blog!)
* Contributions to various World of Warcraft analysis tools

Feel free to check out my [Blog Posts](http://honea.info/year-archive/) if you are interested in any thoughts that might be on my mind regarding various open or closed problems that I feel like working on.
