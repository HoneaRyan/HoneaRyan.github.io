Hey! Welcome to Honea.info. I'm Ryan Honea, a Master's student at Austin Peay State Univeristy. I'm pursuing a degree in Predictive Analytics with aspirations for a Ph.D. in some variation of Operations Research and Statistics. I enjoy developing various software applications in my freetime and tinkering with new projects. My current projects in the works are:

* An Alexa App called Riddle Of The Day that gives Amazon Echo users a convenient Riddle platform
* A Smart Mirror developed in Python with Alexa Integration
* Research in Percolation Theory

Any open-source project in the works will have an RSS feed in my [Portfolio](http://honea.info/portfolio/) so you can keep up with my progress. Feel free to check out my [Blog Posts](http://honea.info/year-archive/) if you are interested in any thoughts that might be on my mind regarding various open or closed problems that I feel like working on.
