The [Bluetooth Text Messenger](https://github.com/HoneaRyan/Bluetooth-Messenger) is a desktop GUI and Droid app that allows for text messaging from the comfort of your laptop or desktop. Using a Windows computer, this .Net application is connected via bluetooth with a Xamarin-developed Droid App. After connecting to your computer, any message received will also be sent to your desktop to a GUI. Messages will be sorted on screen by recency. You can then respond on this GUI and the message will be sent to your phone to then be sent to the receiver.

This was my first true software development project that I did in collaboration with my classmate Benjamin Firth. There is currently no binary executable nor is it on the app store. It does require building by user, but we hope to eventually have a full release. We are always accepting suggestions.
