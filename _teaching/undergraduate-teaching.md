## Statistics Instructing and Tutoring
During my undergraduate, I served as an instructor for the Academic Support Center for introductory statistics courses. This entailed teaching a supplementary course that assisted conditional students in their mathematics courses, algebra review, and referring to individual tutoring. During the Spring, this was a twice-a-week 1.5 hour classroom session, and during the summer, it occurred every day.
